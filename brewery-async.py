def get_brewery_count(state: str) -> Dict:
    """
    Retrieves information about breweries in a state and counts the number
    of breweries. Use page limit of 200 which is the max supported by the 
    Open Brewery DB API https://www.openbrewerydb.org/documentation.
    We use a combination of page and per_page arguments to get information
    about all the breweries in a state since a single API call only returns 
    a maximum of 200 breweries at a time. The page parameter is incremented by
    1 in every call until we get a non 200 response or an empty response.
 
    Args:
        state (string): The full name of a state, case insensitive.
 
    Returns:
        Dict: Dictionary with state name and brewery count. For example: {'state': 'maryland', 'count': 109}.
